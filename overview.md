## Why might I use containers?
{: #overview_why}

Most people want to do one of the following tasks by using containers.

I want to run an HTTP app.
:   I've got some code that I want to deploy for my users to access.

I want to run batch jobs.
:   I've got repeatable tasks I want to run on a regular basis for testing or other purposes.

I want to enforce tight security requirements and have network control over a system of containers.
:   I've got more complex workloads that I want to automate, isolate, secure, manage, and monitor. 

## What options are available to me?
{: #overview_options}
